    // Using the ViewBag on a page to set the title and sub-title
    // This will cause the _AdminLteLayout to include this value in the page title
    // And also set the top titles in the main content area of the page

    // Titles, plus optional icon and URLs
    ViewBag.Breadcrumb = new Breadcrumb(new Crumb[] {
